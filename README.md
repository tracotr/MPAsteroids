# MP-Asteroids

- https://tracotr.itch.io/mpasteroids
- A simple 3D multiplayer asteroids game built in C++ using [raylib](www.raylib.com/) for rendering and [zpl-c/enet](https://github.com/zpl-c/enet) for networking.

## Features
- A server and a client.
- It's like somehow simpler asteroids, but 3d and multiplayer.

## Building
- The main way to build is to open either MPAsteroidsServer or MPAsteroidsClient in VSCode, and hit F5.
- You'll need the Makefile Tools plugin.

## Disclaimer
- This is not fun, nor very good 
- It's simply a project to test C++ game making, as I would prefer to make something in Godot.
- However, the networking part was interesting, and I would like to apply that to other games.
- I don't recommend trying to play this, but I do have gifs to see what it would look like. :)

## Controls
- WASD : Tilt
- QE : ROLL
- R : Forwards
- F : Backwards
- Space : Shoot
